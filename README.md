# social-media-insta-block
Windows 10 | Windows 11 changing hosts file instagram facebook blocker.

This python GUI app helps you instantly block facebook, instagram via hosts file. Its easy to use. Just one button to block. If instagram or facebook blocked. It will write in a label. To get to hosts file this app needs admin access but as you can see in the code it just adds hosts file "127.0.0.1 instagram.com" and etc.

Hope it will help somebody.
