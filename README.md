# social-media-insta-block
Windows 10 | Windows 11 changing hosts file instagram blocker.

This app makes instagram block via hosts file.

When you click "Block" this app writes hosts file "127.0.0.1 www.instagram.com" and "127.0.0.1 instagram.com" to do that you need to get admin rights we can do that in two ways pyuac module or make an exe with "pyinstaller --onefile --uac-admin social-mediablock.pyw" this way when we run the app it will need admin rights and can write hosts file. When you want to Unblock it just click that "Unblock" button

dependencies
#pip install python-hosts
#pip install pyinstaller

How to use
-----------
Make an exe file with pyinstaller and use with admin rights. Or use it with pyuac code which i dont recommend.

Thank you for writing python-hosts tool "Jon Hadfield,jonhadfield"
